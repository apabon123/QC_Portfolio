# Three-Layer CTA Portfolio Framework
## Systematic Futures Trading with Dynamic Strategy Allocation

üéØ **Project Overview**

This project implements a sophisticated three-layer portfolio management system for systematic futures trading, featuring multiple CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) strategies with dynamic allocation, centralized risk management, and production-grade asset filtering.

## üèÜ Core Innovation

The framework separates concerns across **three distinct layers** to solve critical problems in multi-strategy portfolio management:

- **Eliminates conflicting risk management rules** between strategies
- **Enables dynamic strategy allocation** based on recent performance  
- **Solves the "under-investment problem"** faced by traditional volatility-targeted portfolios
- **Provides strategy-specific asset filtering** for multi-asset expansion

## ‚úÖ Current Implementation Status

**üéâ FULLY OPERATIONAL SYSTEM WITH COMPLETE STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATIONS**

- **Layer 1**: Three complete, feature-identical strategies with dynamic loading ‚úÖ
- **Layer 2**: Dynamic allocation system with real-time Sharpe-based rebalancing ‚úÖ
- **Layer 3**: Portfolio risk management delivering consistent 50% volatility targeting ‚úÖ
- **Asset Filtering**: Production-ready system enabling strategy-specific universe filtering ‚úÖ
- **Component Architecture**: Professional modular design with clean separation ‚úÖ
- **Config Compliance**: All parameters loaded from config, zero hardcoded values ‚úÖ

## üîß The Three-Layer Portfolio Management System

### **The Heart of the Framework: Complete Position Weighting Flow**

This is the central innovation that transforms individual strategy signals into final portfolio positions through three coordinated layers:

#### **Step 1: Layer 1 - Individual Strategy Signal Generation**
Each strategy generates "naive" position weights without internal risk management:

```python
# Example strategy outputs:
KestnerCTA_signals = {'ES': 0.25, 'ZN': -0.15, 'NQ': 0.10}    # 25% long ES, -15% short ZN, 10% long NQ
MTUM_CTA_signals =   {'ES': 0.30, 'ZN': 0.20, 'NQ': -0.05}    # 30% long ES, 20% long ZN, -5% short NQ  
HMM_CTA_signals =    {'ES': -0.10, 'ZN': 0.25}                # -10% short ES, 25% long ZN
```

#### **Step 2: Layer 2 - Dynamic Strategy Allocation & Position Combination**
Apply strategy allocations based on recent Sharpe ratios and combine positions:

```python
# Apply strategy allocations:
strategy_allocations = {'KestnerCTA': 0.50, 'MTUM_CTA': 0.30, 'HMM_CTA': 0.20}

# Multiply each strategy's positions by its allocation and sum:
combined_positions = {
    'ES': (0.25√ó0.5) + (0.30√ó0.3) + (-0.10√ó0.2) = 0.195,    # 19.5% net long ES
    'ZN': (-0.15√ó0.5) + (0.20√ó0.3) + (0.25√ó0.2) = 0.035,     # 3.5% net long ZN  
    'NQ': (0.10√ó0.5) + (-0.05√ó0.3) = 0.035                   # 3.5% net long NQ
}
```

#### **Step 3: Layer 3 - Portfolio Volatility Targeting & Risk Scaling**
Calculate portfolio volatility and scale to target:

```python
# Calculate portfolio volatility using covariance matrix:
portfolio_vol = sqrt(w' √ó Œ£ √ó w)  # Example result: 12% portfolio volatility

# Scale to target volatility (50% from config):
leverage_multiplier = target_vol / realized_vol = 50% / 12% = 4.17x

# Apply single multiplier to ALL positions:
final_positions = {
    'ES': 0.195 √ó 4.17 = 0.813,   # 81.3% of portfolio
    'ZN': 0.035 √ó 4.17 = 0.146,   # 14.6% of portfolio
    'NQ': 0.035 √ó 4.17 = 0.146    # 14.6% of portfolio
}
# Result: 110.4% gross exposure, 50% target volatility achieved
```

## üéØ Complete Strategy Implementations

### **Strategy 1: Kestner CTA Strategy** üìà
*Academic replication of Lars Kestner's paper methodology*

**Key Features:**
- **Ensemble approach**: 16/32/52-week momentum models
- **Raw signal averaging**: NO portfolio normalization (key academic correction)
- **Volatility normalization**: (momentum / volatility) √ó ‚àöN formula
- **Variable gross exposure**: 20%-200% based on trend strength
- **Weekly rebalancing**: Responsive to trend changes
- **90-day volatility lookback**: Corrected from 63 days (academic accuracy)

**Expected Performance:**
```
KestnerCTA: Generated 3 targets
  ES: LONG 0.245 (Raw: 0.12, $2.4M)
  NQ: LONG 0.158 (Raw: 0.08, $1.6M)  
  ZN: SHORT 0.089 (Raw: -0.04, $0.9M)
Gross: 49.2%, Net: 31.4%
```

### **Strategy 2: MTUM CTA Strategy** üìä
*Futures adaptation of MSCI USA Momentum methodology*

**Key Features:**
- **Risk-adjusted momentum**: (excess_return - risk_free_rate) / volatility
- **Multi-period ensemble**: 6-month and 12-month lookbacks
- **Signal standardization**: Z-score normalization with ¬±3 std dev clipping
- **Long/short capability**: Unlike equity MTUM's long-only approach
- **Monthly rebalancing**: Reduced transaction costs
- **Enhanced return calculations**: Period-specific volatility and total returns

**Expected Performance:**
```
MTUM_CTA: Generated 2 momentum targets
  ES: LONG 0.185 (Momentum: 1.45, $1.8M)
  ZN: SHORT 0.120 (Momentum: -0.89, $1.2M)
Gross: 30.5%, Net: 6.5%
```

### **Strategy 3: HMM CTA Strategy** üîç
*Hidden Markov Model regime detection for futures*

- **Regime persistence filtering**: Requires 3 consecutive days of same regime
- **Exponential smoothing**: Reduces noise in regime probabilities
- **Monthly model retraining**: Adapts to changing market conditions
- **Weekly rebalancing**: Balance between responsiveness and stability
- **Enhanced validation**: Multiple layers of data quality checks

**Expected Performance:**
